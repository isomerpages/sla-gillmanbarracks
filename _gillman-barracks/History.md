Named after General Sir Webb Gillman, a well-known officer of the British Army, Gillman Barracks was built in 1936. It was home to army barrack buildings, married quarters, and even recreational facilities, built specially for the British’s 1st Battalion before World War II.

During World War II, the Barracks and its surrounding area was one of Singapore’s last battle sites before her fall. Fortunately, the site survived the war when Singapore regained British rule in September 1945. Even after Singapore’s independence, Gillman Barracks was a key site used by the Singapore Armed Forces for the training of national service men.
