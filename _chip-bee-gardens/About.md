SLA manages 409 terrace houses and walk-up apartments in Chip Bee Gardens. Chip Bee Gardens was constructed in the mid-1960s as married quarters for the British Armed Forces. Until the 1970s, it was a residential enclave for their members. Following their withdrawal in the same decade, the estate became a popular district for expatriate teachers teaching in various international schools and tertiary institutions in the area.
